### Description
Our database will model an integrated healthcare database that would be used by health system professionals including doctors, pharmacists, and administrative staff. The goal would be for the database to be used at a provincial level, so a patientâ€™s records from across the healthcare system would be stored in one database. The database will model patients, healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, pharmacists), insurance policies, prescriptions, medical tests, and invoices. By choosing these aspects of the domain, the database could be used by doctors and nurses to check patient records, by pharmacists to view and fill prescriptions, and by administrative staff to invoice insurance payments and track co-payments.
